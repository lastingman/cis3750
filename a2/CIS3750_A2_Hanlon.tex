\section{Client Details}
Malawi is a country located in the warm heart of Africa, with a population of 16.4 million. According to the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee, an estimated 2.83 million people will experience acute food insecurity during the 2015/16 lean season. (World Food Programme, 2016) The economy of the country is based on agriculture. The majority of the people in Malawi are farmers who cultivate tobacco for living. Due to the impact of climate change, decline in global tobacco consumption and the scarcity of food in Malawi, the farmers need to transition to growing different crops. However, since Malawian farmers have been growing tobacco for many generations, the current farmers of the country lack the tools and knowledge required in order to start growing other crops. 

The client for the project is the Agricultural Research and Extension Trust (ARET) of Malawi. They are the premier research institution of Malawi, and are responsible for conducting research and providing technical/extension services on tobacco. The trust was established on September 1, 1995 to foster development and information dissemination for Malawi's tobacco industry. It combined the services of two institutions, the Tobacco Research Institute of Malawi (TRIM) and the Estate Extension Service Trust (EEST), who separately provided research and extension services respectively. (ARET, 2016)

ARET states their new vision is "to be a leading regional centre of excellence in agricultural research and technology dissemination which promotes diversification in the agricultural sector." (ARET, 2016). To accomplish this, they require a software system to collect data on the farmers in Malawi, and distribute research conducted within the organization to the farmers of the country. This project aims to fulfill this need.

\section{Time Estimation}
Assuming the team begins coding the project on October 17, 2016 and finishes the project before December 5, 2016, the team has a total of 49 days to complete the work. \par
Excluding weekends, the team has 35 working days (WDs). Working at a velocity of 80\%, there are 28 productive working days (PWDs) in this period. \par
The project would take 166.5 productive working days for one person to complete, or 209 (208.125) working days. For a team of five, the project would take 36 PWDs, or 45 working days to complete. \par
The project would need 10 more working days to complete than the allotted time period of 35 working days. The project would have the majority of high priority features (must, should), while a few low priority features (could) would not be completed. Approximately 8\% of the total requirements outlined for the project would not be completed (12 out of 144).

\section{Individual Contributions}
\subsection{David DiMaria}
\textbf{Yes! And... Using Improv}\par
The philosophy taught to us by the people at The Making Box has impacted me since in a few different ways. Although I’ve always prided myself on my interpersonal skills and communication, they placed a heavy emphasis on eye contact throughout communication. I’ve found that in my countless group meetings with my team for this course, it has been important to maintain eye contact when someone is trying to get an idea across. It seems like people have a better time articulating themselves if they know that they are getting 100 percent undivided attention. Additionally, the simplicity of never saying no and keeping a conversation going by saying “yes, and”, can help in teamwork a lot more than I thought. Nobody likes getting their ideas shut down, and using the “yes, and” approach helps you build on someone’s idea while not explicitly agreeing with it.\par
	Overall, the improv training was extremely useful. The main question is whether or not it’s a skill that you had before the training, and the training just reinforced it, or if it’s a side to teamwork and communication that you’ve never really been good at. I went to summer camp growing up and eventually became staff their, and the interpersonal communication skills I learned there seemed super intuitive to me. Improv was something that I used every day, whether with inside jokes between staff or just generally having fun at summer camp, everyone had to be clever and “in on it” at all times. Considering that I’m majoring in Computer Science, a safe assumption can be made that on average people within my class have not been exposed to many situations where communication skills shine. As my peers careers progress, I believe they will think back to this improv session and be able to take some lessons from it.

\clearpage
\subsection{Braydon Johnson}
\textbf{The Yes! And... Philosophy}\par
The improv class that was given to us by the making was box was a lot of fun, and I am very interested in the idea behind it. Having never done improv before I was, of course, skeptical about the art in general but also as to how it could apply to our class work. After many spending many hours in the labs working with other people I now see how it applies and why people believe it is a useful skill. The Yes! And... Philosophy is an excellent tool for working with other people especially when it comes to sharing ideas, since generally nobody wants or likes having their ideas rejected. Having other people agree with your idea or build on it, rather than just straight up reject the idea and move on, has a sort of satisfaction about it and certainly promotes people to keep sharing ideas even if they are lacking in content or are slightly off base. After noticing myself and others in my group try to use the Yes! And... Philosophy I tried another of the techniques we learned during our improv class, First Letter Last Letter, in an attempt to focus more when people are talking. I found that this technique did not stack up like Yes! And.. did. The problem I found with it was that I would spend most of my concentration listening to each word individually rather than what they had to say as a whole and would lose track of the conversation.\par
	All in all, I believe that many of the techniques that were presented to us either in the improv class or on the Business Cheatsheet are very useful. The techniques help to promote a friendly environment, which in turn promotes people to contribute to discussions and bring ideas forward that would otherwise have been lost in a person’s shyness. The task of creating a requirements doc in a group of 10+ people was definitely well served by this training, having everyone contribute ideas for requirements or build off other ideas makes the document just that much better. They were also very helpful with developing the team goals since at the time everyone had different ideas of what we were attempting to accomplish.

\subsection{Josh Lemieux}
\textbf{Improvising in Business}\par
To be honest, that day, as soon as I saw that the surprise in store for us was an improv session I immediately put my guard up and convinced myself I would not enjoy this. But, even with my preconceived notions I ended up really enjoying myself. That is a huge testament to Jay and Hayley and I have a lot of respect for them.\par
      	Overall, I can’t say I have used the techniques that they showed us directly. That isn’t to say that they did not provide any benefit though. I think that the listening techniques and the “yes” speech have subconsciously slipped into my brain. Our team seems to be a “yes” team, meaning that we are always listening to each other’s ideas and never instantly turning them down.\par
      	An interesting point of the business cheat sheet is the idea of “celebrating the small victories.” This is important in software development as software development projects are very large. If you are only celebrating when the software is complete, you will be having a depressing time. Adding milestones and celebrating those along the way can provide foreseeable goals to work towards. These will provide satisfaction and motivation to keep reaching the next achievable goal.\par
      	The biggest take away that I got from the improv session though is this, give everything a try. Initially I thought I wouldn’t enjoy the session but maybe that was because I was scared of something new. Since that class I’ve actually been a “yes man” in more of my everyday life. Doing things that I would normally instantly shut down like going to Karaoke or applying for a job that I would think is out of reach.

\subsection{Neivin Mathew}
\textbf{Improving communication with Improv}\par
The improv session in class was not only informative, but a lot of fun as well. At first I was skeptical towards the whole concept of improv and felt that it was irrelevant. However, after a few weeks of collaborating with my team on the project and communicating with the other teams, my perspective has completely changed. \par
	Throughout the term, I've found myself using the "First Letter, Last Letter" method to force myself to listen to my teammates and others more. I find that I am rather guilty of interrupting others when they speak, usually because I'm overly excited to share my opinion. The improv technique has really helped listen to my peers better and think about my response. I find that applying this technique has not only improved my communication with others, but also helped me absorb and respect the opinions of others better. Additionally, I have also found great use for the "Yes! And..." strategy. At first, using this technique felt like an uphill battle. Agreeing with everyone's ideas, no matter how bad they are was truly a struggle for me. I do see the value of keeping an open mind and not limiting yourself to a certain mindset, and this technique really takes that ideology to the extreme. I have definitely noticed that my teammates and peers are more eager to share their ideas when they are not constantly shot down, which has consequently improved the team dynamic.\par
	Overall, I think that the improv training was definitely very helpful to my situation. The techniques outlined there are extreme versions of how team members should e communicating. Establishing a good team environment, where everyone feels that their contribution is valued, is extremely important. This is especially true for software development teams, where everyone's work depends on the work of another. Having a healthy  team atmosphere is conducive to productivity and to the quality of the software. Armed with that knowledge, I think I am much better prepared now to enter the workforce than I was a few months ago.

\subsection{Like Zheng}
\textbf{Yes!And... Philosophy}\par
Before I had the improv training session, I had no idea that improv was so powerful in daily communication. The way that Jay and Hayley spoke really shocked me. I saw that communication within the team, decides its atmosphere and efficiency. It is important to listen to everybody’s ideas and have positive response.\par
Speaking of skills I used, “Yes!And...” and “First Letter, Last Letter” are the two skills I used most frequently after the session. I used to interrupt people when they were speaking, because I couldn't wait to say what I was thinking. I knew that it was a horrible thing to do, but I just couldn't control myself. I saw the opportunity to change when I heard about "First Letter, Last Letter." I practised using this technique and combined it with the "Yes!And..." method. I feel the relationship between my friends and me improving now. I don't need to interrupt them to show them what I'm thinking about. I have started to listen more and have become patient.\par
Honestly, I didn't realize that there was a cheat sheet before I saw the question. However, after I reviewed it, I was reminded of a lot of things from the session. The improv training was very useful. It changed the way I think about communication and cooperation. In this course, communication between the client and developer is extremely necessary. It will determine whether the application we make will satisfy the client and users or not. Thus, listening to what the client has to say and brainstorming ideas with them is better than simply telling the client what we are thinking.
